=Navigating the bitmap=

If you get lost, restore view with Home key.

To move around, hold middle (roll) button and move mouse or hold space and move mouse.

Use arrow keys.

To zoom, roll middle button or use + and - on keyboard.

=Drawing & colors=

To plot/draw, use left or right mouse button (primary and secondary color).

To select new colors use right or left mouse on the palette or press 0-9/A-F for quick selection of primary color.

To swap primary and secondary colors use X key.

==Palette window==

The palette (currently named VIC-II) shows your primary and secondary color selection. You can select primary/secondary color directly from the window with the left and right mouse buttons respectively. The primary color will be marked with a square and the secondary color will be marked with an X.

The secondary color got two extra features: It will be used as the background fill when cutting out a selection. It will be used as the background mask when performing a masked paste

=File formats=

===GPX===
This is the PC file format used by Pixcen. The format saves the full state of the current project including back buffers, undo history and any meta-data applicable. This is meant to be the day to day working format but it's not suitable for exporting data C64 as it's a compressed 32 bit format.

===PNG/BMP/GIF/JPG===
Export and import of these native PC formats is supported via Windows GDI. 

Pixcen is designed to be able to export and import bitmaps without any loss but be aware that there could be bugs. Also, BMP bitmaps exported from other tools like [http://csdb.dk/release/?id=86776 Project One] could use a different palette and that can mean Pixcen will not be able to recreate the bitmap correctly. In this case, using a native C64 format like Koala is the safe way to move pictures between applications.

A word of warning, JPG is a destructive format and should not be used for anything but pure export.
