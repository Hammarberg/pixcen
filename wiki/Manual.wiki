=Navigating the bitmap=

If you get lost, restore view with *Home* key.

To move around, hold middle (roll) button and move mouse or hold *space* and move mouse or use arrow keys.

To zoom, roll middle button or use *+* and *-* on keyboard.

=Drawing & colors=

To plot/draw, use left or right mouse button (primary and secondary color).

To select new colors use right or left mouse on the palette or press *0*-*9*/*A*-*F* for quick selection of primary color.

To swap primary and secondary colors use *X* key.

To pick a new primary color from the image, hold *Shift* while click the left mouse button.

==Palette window==

The palette (currently named VIC-II) shows your primary and secondary color selection. You can select primary/secondary color directly from the window with the left and right mouse buttons respectively. The primary color will be marked with a square and the secondary color will be marked with an X.

The secondary color got two extra features: It will be used as the background fill when cutting out a selection. It will be used as the background mask when performing a masked paste

=Undo & Redo=
Undo is your friend!

Undo and redo history is kept in RAM for 100 iterations and even works over mode change. 

Undo and Redo is found under the Edit menu or by keyboard *CTRL*+*Z* and *CTRL*+*Y*.

=Select=
Select is the first step required for many tools.

To manually select an area, hit the *M* key and then drag with the mouse. Tip: If you want to select an area larger than your visible screen, you can use the arrow keys to move.

To select everything, press *CTRL*+*A*.

To select the current cell press *Shift*+*C*.

To deselect or cancel any selection hit *ESC* or press *CTRL*+*D*.

===Auto-select Cell===
Available as an option under the Edit menu. This feature is handy when working on block graphics like chars or sprites as it will automatically select the current cell upon mouse hovering. The auto-selection can temporary be overridden with any of the other select methods.

===Snap selection to Cell===
Available as an option under the Edit menu. This feature will align any selection or paste operations to complete cells. Many operations can only be done successfully on complete cell boundaries.

=Copy=
Available as an option under the Edit menu or by pressing *CTRL*+*C*.

A copied section of the image is converted to RGB and placed on the Windows clipboard. This makes cross application copy and paste possible.

=Cut=
Available as an option under the Edit menu or by pressing *CTRL*+*X*.

Cut behaves like copy except that the secondary color is used to fill the the selected area.

=Paste=
Available as an option under the Edit menu or by pressing *CTRL*+*V*.

When invoked, a temporary layer is created. The pasted image is not merged until you press the left mouse button. This gives you the chance to place the image.

If you want to abort the paste operation, simply hit *ESC* at this point.

When clicking the left mouse button the temporary layer is merged with the background image. Depending on the graphics mode, the number of colors involved, color overflow settings and more, the merged result can be truncated. This is not an error but simply the restrictions of the C64 graphics formats or any other restriction enforced by settings. If you are unhappy with the results simply undo.

==Masked paste==
Available as an option under the Edit menu or by pressing *CTRL*+*Shift*+*V*.

Behaves like paste except that the secondary color is used as a background mask.

Tip: This can be used to fake brushes until those are implemented.

=Preview window=
Available as an option under the View menu or by pressing *CTRL*+*P*.

The preview window can be navigated and zoomed with the mouse in a similar way to the main view. You can also open multiple preview windows.

==Pixel Aspect Ratio (PAR)==
Under View -> Preview pixel aspect ratio, you can change the PAR for the preview window(s). Default is PC(1:1) but this might not be a good representation of the image on the real thing. The pixels on the C64 are slightly taller than they are wide.

=Cell window=
The cell window is a bit advanced and if you are a casual artist you probably only want to set the background/border color and not bother with the rest. If you are drawing graphics with specific restrictions or if you are a coder preparing graphics, then this is for you.

There are two types of colors in the window:

Indexed colors are represented by a square icons. These colors are unique per cell of the image. In a bitmap they represent color RAM and/or screen RAM. In character mode and sprite mode there is only one indexed color and that is color RAM or individual sprite color respectively. When you mouse over the image, you will notice the indexed colors might change with the location.

Global colors are represented by round icons. These colors are shared across the image (in technical terms these are some or more of $D020-$D024).

In order to manipulate indexed colors you must first do a [Manual#Select selection] on an area covering one or more cells. For global colors, no selection is needed.

All manipulation is done by right clicking an icon in the cell window. A popup menu will show a palette as well as options to cripple, decripple, lock and unlock. There are also some currently unused options for future expansion.

===Cripple===
It's possible to clipple an indexed color into behave like a global color. Pixcen will treat a crippled color like it is a global color.

===Lock===
Locked colors are marked with a red line crossing the icon. They are locked in the sense that when drawing, Pixcen will not under any circumstances try to change it. Otherwise, if the color is unused, Pixcen might decide to change it. Some colors like (global background) will be locked by default.

===Background color===
In all modes except single color bitmap and unrestricted the _0_ mask in the cell window is global and represents the background color, switching background color is done by right clicking this icon and select a new color from the drop down palette.

In single color bitmap mode or unrestricted mode, there is no global color for background. To switch the background color (on a preferably new and empty bitmap), select the desired background color from the palette as your secondary color. Select the entire image with *CTRL*+*A* then hit *Delete* or *Backspace* and the entire image will be filled with the secondary color.

===Border color===
The border color is always global and marked as _Bd_ in the cell window. By default it's set to light blue but some file formats preserve border color. Pixcen will preserve this color when possible. You also want to set the border color before exporting a [Manual#C64_Exe C64 executable].

=File formats=

===GPX===
This is the PC file format used by Pixcen. The format saves the full state of the current project including back buffers, undo history and any meta-data applicable. This is meant to be the day to day working format and it's not suitable for exporting data C64 as it's a compressed 32 bit format.

===PNG/BMP/GIF/JPG===
Export and import of these native PC formats is supported via Windows GDI. 

Pixcen is designed to be able to export and re-import images without any loss but be aware that there could be bugs. Also, BMP bitmaps exported from other tools like [http://csdb.dk/release/?id=86776 Project One] could use a different palette and that can mean Pixcen will not be able to recreate the image correctly. In this case, using a native C64 format like [Manual#Koala Koala] is a safer way to move images between applications.

A word of warning, JPG is a destructive format and should not be used for anything but pure export.

===Advanced Art Studio===

===Cenimate===

===Paint Magic===

===Art Studio===

===C64 Exe===
This format is export only and is only available under certain  conditions. For bitmap modes the resolutions must be full screen. For character mode the resolution must be full screen and the character count must not exceed 256.

The produced file will be compressed with [http://csdb.dk/release/?id=109317 Byte Boozer] and can be executed directly on C64.

==Binary & PRG formats==
The following low level export formats exists in two versions: binary and PRG. Binary is suitable for cross development as many cross development tools such as assemblers can include binary data directly (a binary file could also be treated as a SEQ or USR-file on C64). PRG is the more common native C64 format, it's a binary prefixed with a 16 bit load address. When exporting any of the p??? formats a dialog will ask for the address to prefix.

===Bitmap RAM===
This format is currently export only and is always available. The bitmap RAM represents the raw bitmap per row of cells from left to right, top to bottom, 8 bytes per cell. Likewise, for sprites this means rows of sprites from left to right, top to bottom, 64 bytes per cell where the last byte always is zero. In character mode this is the non indexed bitmap just like bitmap mode and you might want to consider saving an indexed char map & indexed screen instead.

In unrestricted mode this format is very different. Pixels are saved in scan lines from left to right, top to bottom, one byte per pixel. The byte is double nibbled, color 1 is represented as $11 and color 2 as $22, etc.

===Screen RAM===
This format is currently export only and is available for bitmap mode. The screen RAM contains the color data for mask 01 and 10 in bitmap multi color mode or mask 0 and 1 in bitmap single color mode. The colors are encoded as high nibble and low nibble, one byte per cell from left to right, top to bottom. This data is commonly loaded at address $0400 on the C64.

===Color RAM===
This format is currently export only and is available for all modes except unrestricted. The color RAM contains the color data for mask 11 in bitmap/char multi color mode or mask 1 in single color char mode. The colors are encoded as low nibble with the high nibble always set to zero, one byte per cell from left to right, top to bottom. This data is commonly used at address $D800 on the C64.

For sprite mode the color ram represents the individual sprite color set at $D027-$D02E.

===Indexed char map & Index screen===
These formats are currently export only and available for char mode if the unique character count is no more than 256. The indexed map is a set of all unique characters represented in the bitmap while the index screen contains the index pointers to these unique chars. The map will be saved in chunks of 8 bytes in the order they appear in the original map with the possible exception if index $20 (offset $100) that will hold the first empty character discovered. The index screen will be saved from left to right, top to bottom. When exporting the indexed map and index screen it's important not to make any alterations to the image between the two exports as the generated data could become out of sync.
